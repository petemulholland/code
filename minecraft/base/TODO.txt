TODO:
 - 2nd floor turrets properly mirrored, looks good.
 - think the torches inside on 2nd floor are correct now, but not tested
* Add windows & torches to corridors to turrets
* do something with down stairs foyer, need torches at min, maybe add book shelves
* Extend turrets up 1 floor
* add battlements to roof
* Kitchen furnaces, not rotated!
* Looks big & square currently, add beams extending out so ends show in walls.
* Add glass pyramid to roof
* maybe add balconies on 2nd floor corridors to break up squareness

* need to be careful about naming sections ( sections with same name will overwraite existing e.g. ground floor walls)
