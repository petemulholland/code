* bugs:
	DONE: small houser ladder missing - orientation wrong
	blacksmith:
		DONE: fence placed outside building
		DONE: chest placed in same block as anvil
		DONE: furnaces placed 1 block west of correct pos 

	church 
		** roof applied all the way to top of tower
		DONE: ladder missing (orientation)
		DONE: stairs at back place 1 block towards door.





* orientation
	- had assumed +x => E & +z => N
	- appears North is -z
	* what does this mean for other code/oriented blocks?

coordinates:
http://gametipcenter.com/minecraft-how-to-navigate-using-coordinates
N => -Z
E = > +X
S => +Z
W => -x

* look at building rel_pos & build_pos
	DONE: reposition building ctor params? need pos, & orientation, offset could be made default
	TODO: retest all buildings in game (see debug_village for run_build_tests & clear_build_tests methods)

* lamp posts - wool color correct & torch orientation correct (was passing block with data=0 for id, which api expands to id & data)
	TODO: check torch orientation now after reorienting north/south

* Small house:
	* windows ok
	* doors set at level 2 are half doors - need to find details
	* right hand side of inner space is not cleared (wrong west wall coords, (on north facing house?)
		- TODO test fix
		- TODO set stuff on walls to figure out what's what
	* stairs are oriented but 180 degrees about (north faces south etc)
		- is this related to north being negative Z ? YES - had set stairs to south, reset to NORTH after north/south reorientation
	* ladders are ok!
	* are torches inside house good?

* create tests for oriented blocks
	- are doors & windows oriented - see checks below

* TODO: figure out doors, by manually creating in game and querying block data
* doors not created right, need orientation data & raise up 1 level ?
