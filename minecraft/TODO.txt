full village build
	- west facing torches on lampposts are placed east facing on adjacent wall.
		(east facing torches on other side are ok.)
	DONE - blacksmith roof slabs look like full cobblestone blocks.(was coded as cobblestone)
	
	- streets aren't visible - built 1 level below ground
		- ground level is showing as 5
		- gravel was built at 4
		 can dig down more than 4 layers
			TODO: Create a script to clear steps down x levels.

		 TODO: dig down and getTilePos() for levels below 4.
	
	- figure out doors
		TODO : 
			place door jams on all 4 sides of player (2 high)
			manually place doors 
				- if i place door on righ jam will it hinge on that side & visa versa for right jam?)
			use getBlockWithData for both door blocks (do the jam blocks change?)

			place jams 1 block high
			what happens when a door is palced in these spaces?
				- need to figure out if i have to place my door after building both layers for door jams.

			NOTE: in creative, doors needed to be placed on ground block between jams.

	- figure out how to correctly place crops using api.
		TODO:
			place 2x8 (longer? 9 or 10 long?) blocks of dirt
				- if farmland is available as placeable block try that for a 3rd column
				- try placing grass too & planting on that

			place crops on all blocks.
			use bone meal to grow crops to increasing levels (0 bonemeal on first block, 1 on 2nd, 2 on 3rd etc.)

			use getBlockWithData on all dirt blocks & blocks above with crops.

30/03:

DONE - test scripts set back 2x the space between,, corners touching

Small hs v2 & v3
	- N/S torched on side wall, E/W torches over doors (Why - set the same as V1, and no issues there!!)

Farms
	- crops placed too high? drop as seeds
		- is the farmland block set correctly?, check diffs between dirt & farmland placed in game
		- do the crops need to be palced in same block as farmland or block above?
		- can I apply bone meal then?


large house:
	- wood plank about 5 spaces east of building at window level TODO: chekc Large house builds to ensure this is fixed

* TODO Investigation:
	- Can trap door be placed on fence for table top.
	- what's the block type for trap door.
	- what's the block type for wood planks half block

DOORS: 
	in north wall placed closed door shows as:
	bottom: Block(64, 3)
	top: Block(64,8)

	try placing other data values in gap see what displays


* bugs:
	Farm:
	* crops should be placed on block above farmland (can be placed above dirt)
	* replace dirt with farm land
	* farm land => tilled dirt
	* wheat crops appear to be block (59,0) - not documented 
		(59,7) is full grown crop.
		try setting data value 0-7
		data vals 8-15 create other block types, 
	data wraps back round at 16
	* pumpkin seed(?) just planted => Block(105,0)
		try setting data values, goes up to 15

* bugs:
	blacksmith:
		no iron bars, iron doors don't appear

	TODO: Doors - haven't figured these out yet need to do a getBlock with data on door

TODO !!!

* testing:
	* test farm
		TODO: there's a farmland block, are crop types data values for this?
