TODO: 
	have a read of this: http://www.micromart.co.uk/gaming/raspberry-pi/753/how-hack-minecraft-python-raspberry-pi-build-module
	talks about creating modules for minecraft code, might be something useful in it.
	Do this before trying to setup menu for building on hits.

	API ref: http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html
	Iron bars & pressure plates not listed, need to figure out in game.
		- figure out potatos, carrots and sugarcane too.


* TODO: Updates to village blueprints
	- Should be able to use wooden pressure plate for table top on Windows
		- find block type & update buildings with tables. (blacksmith, butcher & library)
	- update blacksmith to include iron bars beside lava

	- Farms, try planting potatoes, carrots & sugar cane

	TODO: update build so step is not placed if door is level with ground, (need to check if block in front of step is solid.)


* TODO menu to interact with mouse clicks:
	1. set start pos for menu (all building offsets should be relative to this?)
		- seemed like a good idea, not sure why. (calculate click position relative to start, 
												for display on menu so its easier to figure out if building in right place)

	2. menu L1:
		* build here (display pos relative to start pos)
		* ignore click
		* flush clicks
		
		Build here (L2):
			* select building from list
			
			L3 - pick build to left or right of pos
			L4 - builds to east, west north or south of pos
			L5 - level with ground or raised?
			
	- building over air? - use mc.getHeight to find highest non-air block at each of the corners of a building?
		- then figure out how to build in that space?

	- Are player.getRotation & getPitch any use to the menu app?

	polling for block hits:
		blockEvents = mc.events.pollBlockHits()
		for blockEvent in blockEvents:
			print blockEvent

	flush events:
		mc.events.clearAll()




	- figure out doors
		DONE : 
			place door jams on all 4 sides of player (2 high)
			manually place doors 
				- if i place door on righ jam will it hinge on that side & visa versa for right jam?)
			use getBlockWithData for both door blocks (do the jam blocks change?)

			place jams 1 block high
			what happens when a door is palced in these spaces?
				- need to figure out if i have to place my door after building both layers for door jams.

			NOTE: in creative, doors needed to be placed on ground block between jams.

	- figure out how to correctly place crops using api.
		DONE: (was trying to place on dirt, not farmland)
			place 2x8 (longer? 9 or 10 long?) blocks of dirt
				- if farmland is available as placeable block try that for a 3rd column
				- try placing grass too & planting on that
			till one side.
			place crops on all blocks.
			use bone meal to grow crops to increasing levels (0 bonemeal on first block, 1 on 2nd, 2 on 3rd etc.)

			use getBlockWithData on all dirt blocks & blocks above with crops.
