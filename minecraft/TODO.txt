* bugs:
	DONE: small houser ladder missing - orientation wrong
	blacksmith:
		DONE: fence placed outside building
		DONE: chest placed in same block as anvil
		DONE: furnaces placed 2 blocks west of correct pos 
		no iron bars, iron doors don't appear

	church 
		DONE: ** roof applied all the way to top of tower (was using north pos for full wall lengths)
		DONE: ladder missing (orientation)
		DONE: stairs at back place 1 block towards door.
		TODO: check torches inside

	Small House 
		TODO: some windows not created properly, but some are.

	TODO: Doors - haven't figured these out yet need to do a getBlock with data on door

TODO !!!
	for all buildings change all magic number coords, to door_pos + relative pos

	rework all building coords from SW or SE corner of building extent
	- do something to create building from either south corner.

* testing:
	* confirm fixes for blacksmith, church & small house
	* test farm
		TODO: there's a farmland block, are crop types data values for this?
	* test large house
	* 

* orientation
	- had assumed +x => E & +z => N
	- appears North is -z
	* what does this mean for other code/oriented blocks?

TODO: add optional description param to BuildingBlock for debugging & update __str__ to add to output
	Update classes to use descr, update buildings to add descr to blocks as created.

TODO: Building still to create:
	DONE * farms, just 2 levels
	* Library - 9 levels with peaked roof - has tables, trap door for table top?
	* butcher - 8 levels with peaked roof 
	* large house - L/T shpaed peaked roof looks interesting, only 1 variation blueprinted
coordinates:

N => -Z
E = > +X
S => +Z
W => -x


* create tests for oriented blocks
	- are doors & windows oriented - see checks below

* TODO: figure out doors, by manually creating in game and querying block data
* doors not created right, need orientation data & raise up 1 level ?
