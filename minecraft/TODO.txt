DOORS:

	top: Block(64,8)

	try placing other data values in gap see what displays
* TODO:
	- rework buildings
	- remove offset from BuildingBlocks
	- update all buildings with width
	- update all building layouts relative to south east corner.
	- add build_left_from_point() & build_right_rom_point() to Building 

	- update tester to build left & right from points

* bugs:
	Library:
	DONE* need to set width correctly

	DONE* south window placed to south of building 5 meters away
	DONE* no books - in game placed books show as Block(47,0)

	Church:

	DONE* need to set width value correctly
	DONE* need to place farmland & put crops above?
	DONE?* is water placed correctly??

	* replace dirt with farm land
	* farm land => tilled dirt
	* wheat crops appear to be block (59,0) - not documented 
		(59,7) is full grown crop.
		try setting data value 0-7
		data vals 8-15 create other block types, 
	data wraps back round at 16

	for all buildings change all magic number coords, to door_pos + relative pos

	rework all building coords from SW or SE corner of building extent
	- do something to create building from either south corner.

* testing:
	* confirm fixes for blacksmith, church & small house
	* test farm
		TODO: there's a farmland block, are crop types data values for this?
	* test large house
	* 

* orientation
	- had assumed +x => E & +z => N
	- appears North is -z
	* what does this mean for other code/oriented blocks?

TODO: add optional description param to BuildingBlock for debugging & update __str__ to add to output
	Update classes to use descr, update buildings to add descr to blocks as created.

TODO: Building still to create:
	DONE * farms, just 2 levels

N => -Z
E = > +X
S => +Z
W => -x


* create tests for oriented blocks
	- are doors & windows oriented - see checks below

* TODO: figure out doors, by manually creating in game and querying block data
* doors not created right, need orientation data & raise up 1 level ?
