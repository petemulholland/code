* create tests for oriented blocks
	- are doors & windows oriented - see checks below

* data not "taking" in game for stair orientation & wool color (& probably ladders)
	- find north.
	- manually (in game) create a black wool walls oriented n,s,e & w
	- add a stair & a ladder on each
	- stand on black wool:
		run getTilePos
		run getBlockWithData
	- for each stair & ladder on each wall orientation
		- stand in fornt of ladder/on stair:
			run getTilePos
			run getBlock with data
	- add a door & window in each wall
		- haven't seen orientation for these blocks
		- figure out the position of each and call getBlockWithData on coord 
			for both spaces for the door, I'm only seeing half doors, do they need to be placed in the upper part of the space?

* dig out api code copied from pi to laptop and look at the set block code
	- See TODO comments:
		- mcpi.Block implementation - does it implement __str__ and clone?

	- try adding maps of id & data to str, for __str__ implementations

* implement bitmask for tester.run, so I can run the build parts without the following clear.

* doors not created right, need orientation data & raise up 1 level ?
* glass panes not right? need orientation?
